### Add Two Numbers [Medium]

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score [Medium]

You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer 1 and you want to reach the integer target.

In one move, you can either:

Increment the current integer by one (i.e., x = x + 1).
Double the current integer (i.e., x = 2 * x).

### Minimum Window Substring [Hard]

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum 
window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
